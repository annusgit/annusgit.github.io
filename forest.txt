Title: Monitoring Forest Cover Change Patterns Using Fully Convolutional Network Over Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project Regions, Pakistan

The importance of forests on Earth cannot be emphasized enough. Forests cover roughly 30% of the Earth’s surface and are home to 80% of terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. However, due to human development activities and natural disasters, these forests and ecosystems associated with them are under significant pressure of degradation and desertification. Around 2.3 million square kilometers of world’s forest cover has been lost between 2000 and 2012 causing not only financial losses but also severely damaging associated biodiversity and ecosystems. Unlike developed countries, the developing countries do not have the resources or budgets to conduct manual surveys to monitor forest change trends for long periods and hence they rely on estimations. We have developed a reliable method based on local data for proper quantification of forest cover change by using open source tools and techniques, which will help developing countries in more accurate estimation of the forests in order to counter challenges like climate change. 

Pakistan is among the worst hit countries by forest degradation and deforestation and if appropriate measures are not taken, the country is likely to lose all of its forests in the next thirty to
fifty years. To overcome this problem, the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) initiated
the Billion Tree Tsunami (BTT) afforestation project. We have developed a satellite based image
analysis approach to quantitatively monitor the forest cover change as a result of BTT afforestation in KP
districts of Pakistan. The method is based on State-of-the-Art deep convolution neural networks based semantic
segmentation models. The analysis is completely data driven and has been performed using Freely Available Landsat-8 satellite imagery showing an average forest cover improvement of around 39% from 2014 to 2018. The change detection results and deforestation/afforestation hotspots identified during our analysis provide important insights into the forest change trends that will help in filling gaps in policy making that is essential for ensuring sustainable management of forests in Pakistan.
