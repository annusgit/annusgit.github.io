                The importance of forests on Earth cannot be emphasized enough. Forests cover roughly 30% of the Earth’s surface and are home to 80% of terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. However, due to human development activities and natural disasters, these forests and ecosystems associated with them are under significant pressure of degradation and desertification. Around 2.3 million square kilometers of world’s forest cover has been lost between 2000 and 2012 causing not only financial losses but also severely damaging associated biodiversity and ecosystems. Unlike developed countries, the developing countries do not have the resources or budgets to conduct manual surveys to monitor forest change trends for long periods and hence they rely on estimations. We have developed a reliable method based on local data and machine learning techniques for proper quantification of forest cover change by using open source tools and techniques, which will help developing countries in more accurate estimation of the forests in order to counter challenges like climate change.

                Pakistan is among the worst hit countries by forest degradation and deforestation and if appropriate measures are not taken, the country is likely to lose all of its forests in the next thirty to fifty years. To overcome this problem, the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) initiated the Billion Tree Tsunami (BTT) afforestation project. We have developed a satellite based image analysis approach to quantitatively monitor the forest cover change as a result of BTT afforestation in KP districts of Pakistan. The method is based on State-of-the-Art deep convolution neural networks based semantic segmentation models. The analysis is completely data driven and has been performed using Freely Available Landsat-8 satellite imagery showing an average forest cover improvement of around 39% from 2014 to 2018. The change detection results and deforestation/afforestation hotspots identified during our analysis provide important insights into the forest change trends that will help in filling gaps in policy making that is essential for ensuring sustainable management of forests in Pakistan.

                Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is one of the five provinces in Pakistan and has the highest land area covered with forest at provincial level. In 2014, the Billion Tree Tsunami (BTT) Project was launched in response to the International Bonn Challenge by the KP government in Pakistan. This challenge aims to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in the world by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. It was initiated by the German government and the International Union for conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2011 and was later extended by New York declaration on Forest at the 2014 UN Climate Summit. In total, there are 25 districts in KP province in which the BTT project afforestation drives have been carried out. Our work focused on 17 out of 25 BTT districts that had a considerable forest cover to begin with and included Hangu, Karak, Kohat, Nowshehra, Battagram, Abbottabad, Kohistan, Haripur, Tor Ghar, Mansehra, Buner, Chitral, Lower Dir, Malakand, Shangla, Swat and Upper Dir.

                In order to make our forest cover change analysis locally optimized for Pakistani regions, we used publicly available land cover maps from the government of Pakistan. These maps look like the kind of maps you would find in an elementry Pakistan Studies text book. The available land cover maps for the BTT districts are only for the year 2015. This means that in order to perform a long-term change analysis, we needed to generate forest cover maps for the whole period for which the BTT project existed, i.e., 2014-2018. This is where machine learning comes in. If a machine learning model is able to learn how satellite images can be used to generate forest cover maps using satellite images of BTT districts and the available land cover maps of these districts, then it should be able to generate forest cover maps for these districts for the whole period from 2014 to 2018 if satellite images for these years are available.

                A number of free-to-use satellite sources are available for research purposes and one of the most popular sources is the Landsat-8 satellite. The Landsat program is owned by NASA. It has been running since 1972 and Landsat-8 is the latest of its series of satellites. It provides images at a spatial resolution of 30 meters per pixel and revisits all places on Earth after every 16 days. We have used Landsat-8 imagery from 2014 to 2018 for all the 17 districts of the BTT project for this research.

                The problem with our local government data maps as shown in <a href="">Figure-2</a> is that they can't be readily used for applying any machine learning or statistical analysis because they are not in a format that computers can understand for analysis purposes; they are only meant for visualization. In order to transform the data to a more analytically useful format, we semi-automatically digitized these maps using Google Earth Engine and produced our own digitized copies of these maps ready for experimentation.

                After performing comparisons of various statistical machine learning models with deep learning based semantic segmentation, we decided to go forward with the latter. There are two reasons for this that we learnt during our comparitive experiments mentioned earlier. Firstly, deep neural networks are defined by layers and operators, such as 2D and 3D convolutions, linear dot products, etc., and they extract features from the training data automatically and hence hand-crafted features are not needed as is the case with most statistical models. This results in a high-level of abstraction in designing neural network architectures and modern deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch and Tensorflow allow such networks to be designed quickly. Secondly, deep neural networks can be fine tuned, therefore pre-trained neural network layers that were trained on other similar datasets may be used in designing newer architectures since these layers learn must faster from newer datasets and allow the whole model to converge more quickly. Our forest cover segmentation model is based on the popular deep neural network model UNet and is implemented in Pytorch framework.

                A UNet is called a "U-Net" because of its U-shaped architecture. The first half of the network is an encoder, a fully convolutional feature extractor network like the VGG network but its classification head (dot products and softmax) is removed. An encoder may be viewed as multiple modules stacked one after the other such that the input of a module feeds fromthe output of the previous one. The operators used in all modules of this encoder are CONV, BatchNorm, ReLU, andMax POOL. Four of such modules comprise the encoder of our UNet, and it is known as a four-stage encoder. The other half of the UNet, the decoder, is the mirror image of the first half, a four-stage decoder. Each module in a decoder consists of Transposed CONV operation followed by a copy-and-fuse connection between the corresponding stages of encoder and decoder. It is followed by CONVs along with BatchNorm, ReLU andMax Pool. This concatenation operation of encoder and decoder outputs allows the decoder to utilize the features extracted by the encoder at subsequent stages. The encoder (dotted square on the left) is where the input tensor is downsampled and encoded into a smaller dimensional vector. The decoder (dotted square on the right) decodes this vector and produces full resolution segmentation for the input image. Each decoder module concatenates its output with the encoder output at the corresponding stage and the final decoder tensor is passed through a convolution again followed by a softmax layer which normalizes the output probabilities for both classes at each pixel.

The arrows indicate tensor outputs from the encoder being copied and concatenated with the transposed convolution decoder output along the depth dimension.

                We utilized Landsat-8 satellite images along with our digitized maps for BTT districts for the year 2015 and trained a state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation model that became capable of recognizing forest cover in a given satellite image. This model performed pixel-wise detection of forest cover to label all the pixels in a satellite image that it classified as forest with approximately 85% accurary, which is good considering the low resolution of the satellite images (30 meters per pixel).

Set of all images in 2015 with less than 10% cloud cover are filtered and pixel wise median values are calculated for each band to generate a composite image. This image represent clean image of the year. The paper printed map is taken as a reference and forest/non-forest data points are labelled on this clean Landsat-8 image. This small set of data points is used to train a classifier that labels all the rest of the pixels in the clean Landsat-8 image. The result of this labelling is a digitized forest cover map. Then a Unet model is trained with clean Landsat-8 district images of 2015 as input and the target labels are the digitized forest cover maps of 2015. The trained model performs inference on the clean Landsat-8 district images of 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018, yielding a temporal series of forest cover maps.

                At this point, we had a trained model that could recognize forest cover in satellite images of BTT districts. The land cover maps that the government made public were only for the year 2015. Since we already had the digitized maps of 2015, we used our trained model to detect forest cover in satellite images of BTT districts for the years 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018. This way, we generated forest cover maps for the whole period from 2014-2018 for 17 districts of the BTT project. This data can be used to detect forest cover change between consecutive years as well as generate full trends for the five year change.
